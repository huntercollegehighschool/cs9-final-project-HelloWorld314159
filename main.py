print("Welcome to Worldle. You must guess a five letter word in six tries. \nOn your first guess, you will input a five letter word, and you will be shown with brackets if it is not in the word(()), in the word but in the wrong place ([]), or in the word and in the right place ({}). \nFor example, if you guess 'stare', and recieve (S)(T){A}[R][E], S and T are not in the word, R and E are in the word, but not in those positions, and A is in the word, in the same place as the guess. \nYour incorrect letters will be displayed above each guess. Each guess must have exactly five letters,  with no repeats of letters. This game was created by Josh Wardle. Good luck!")
